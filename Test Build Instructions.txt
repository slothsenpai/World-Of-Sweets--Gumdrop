TO BUILD:  gradle -PmainClass=wos/GUITest build

TO RUN NORMALLY:  gradle -PmainClass=wos/GUITest run
OR:  gradle -PmainClass=wos/GameRunner execute

TO TEST THE WIN CONDITIONS:  gradle -PmainClass=wos/GUITest execute
*any number of new tests can be added by coding them, and then replacing GUITest above with the correct class name.



This branch includes a test to make sure all variations of the final stretch will compute as a win in the game's logic.  

However, the ability to switch between running the game normally and running the test requires modifying gradle.build.  The instructions to run are included above.

Even if you want to run the game normally, you need to include "-PmainClass=***" to satify the new execute command.  I would recommend deleting this change for submission, unless you want to submit these as manual tests.
