Deliverable 2 Movement Writeup
Addison Beall

To test the movement logic for the tokens, we had to manually play the game and ensure the pieces were moving to the
correct space corresponding to the card drawn. We used a println to get the expected space to move to and could visually
confirm that the piece either had or had not moved to that space. Generally the token moved where expected, but when the 
token was nearing the goal some issues appeared. Sometimes the token wouldn't move to the goal state and could get denied the win.
After some code fixes this seemed to stop, but has come up intermittenly. I believe it may be due to an Off-by-one error, but 
further testing needs to be done to confirm this. It will be an issue during our next deliverable.
